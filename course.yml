description          : Text is the most common and most basic form of information that we encounter every day. However, with powerful computing tools and software including Python, we have opened new possibilities to organize and extract data from this old medium. In this class, you will learn how to do basic manipulations on text such as indexing and slicing, how to use regular expression (regex) to search and replace strings, and finally, build a text mining system to predict the follow-up word for a certain word.
